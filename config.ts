  longDescription: `My name is Marin Heƒëe≈°, I'm a ${calculateAge(
    "2001/02/23",
  )} year old self-taught graphic/motion designer and a developer based in üá≠üá∑ Slavonski Brod, Croatia. I love learning and gathering new experiences which is what drives me to try something new every once in a while. Hate studying. Can't live without music. Aged 15, decided to skip on college and teach myself design and programming. Got into open source back in 2020, started learning new skills and getting experience in various fields while building projects with great people and now I'm looking forward to where it'll take me next. I specialize in graphic/motion design (branding, UI/UX, web design, photoshop, promo), building brands, marketing/advertising, project/product/community management, public relations, desktop/mobile/web app development and web development.`,

        "Joining dahliaOS through Camden Bruce, I started as a graphic designer designing various promotional/marketing material, user interfaces, logos, wallpapers and more. After a few months, I moved onto a more managerial role where I took on the challenge to spread the word about dahliaOS, improve our presence and expand our horizons. I overlooked almost every aspect of the project making sure that our work is consistent and of good quality, that the team is productive, communicative and well-guided. I helped the team get more organized by introducing a few tools and guidelines that helped boost our productivity and improve task management. On the side, I also did some community management, wrote and designed most of the posts, engaged with our community, ran ads for the project on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Software development-wise, worked on various applications, the desktop enviroment and our website.",

Aside from the BlissLabs organization, I also chose to work on Bliss OS, Bliss ROM and Android-Generic projects to help them grow, too. Shortly after I joined, I was picked for the new design and PR lead. I've led BlissLabs through a rebrand where we changed the logo and the name from Bliss Family of ROMS to BlissLabs. Consulted the team leads on project sustainability and management. I also took part in the negotiations between Astian and BlissLabs regarding joining the forces in creating a cloud suite. Design-wise, I designed various promotional/marketing content. In general, helped with recruiting (HR), business management, PR (social media). Introduced them to a few tools that helped boost productivity and improve task management.",
