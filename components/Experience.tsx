              Joining dahliaOS through Camden Bruce, I started as a graphic
              designer designing various promotional/marketing material, user
              interfaces, logos, wallpapers and more. After a few months, I
              moved onto a more managerial role where I took on the challenge to
              spread the word about dahliaOS, improve our presence and expand
              our horizons. I overlooked almost every aspect of the project
              making sure that our work is consistent and of good quality, that
              the team is productive, communicative and well-guided. I helped
              the team get more organized by introducing a few tools and
              guidelines that helped boost our productivity and improve task
              management. On the side, I also did some community management,
              wrote and designed most of the posts, engaged with our community,
              ran ads for the project on platforms such as Facebook and
              Instagram. Software development-wise, worked on various
              applications, the desktop environment and our website.

              I was invited to join the BlissLabs non-profit organization by Jon
              West to help them progress further and get the team back on its
              feet. Aside from the BlissLabs organization, I also chose to work
              on Bliss OS, Bliss ROM and Android-Generic projects to help them
              grow, too. Shortly after I joined, I was picked for the new design
              and PR lead. I&apos;ve led BlissLabs through a rebrand where we
              changed the logo and the name from Bliss Family of ROMS to
              BlissLabs. Consulted the team leads on project sustainability and
              management. I also took part in the negotiations between Astian
              and BlissLabs regarding joining the forces in creating a cloud
              suite. Design-wise, I designed various promotional/marketing
              content. In general, helped with recruiting (HR), business
              management, PR (social media). Introduced them to a few tools that
              helped boost productivity and improve task management.
