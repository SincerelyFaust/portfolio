## Development

To develop and locally test the website:

### 1. Clone

Clone this repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SincerelyFaust/website
```

### 2. Install development tools:

1. [Install Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
1. [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended opposed to NPM/Yarn)
1. Code editor of your choice (I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### 3. Install dependencies:

Install node modules required to run the website by running:

```
pnpm i
```

### 4. Start the Next.js dev server:

```
pnpm dev
```

In a browser, load the page [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should now be able to test the website while making your changes.
Next.js' dev server has hot reloading so no need to restart the instance when it's running!

### 5. Build:

After making your changes and verifying it all works in the dev server, furtherly test them out by building the website:

```
pnpm build
```

### 6. Start:

```
pnpm start
```

In a browser, load the page [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should now be able to view the built website.
